== DESCRIPTION

Tapout is a TAP handler. Tapout supports TAP-Y/J as well as traditional TAP.

TAP-Y/J is a modernization of TAP using pure YAML/JSON streams.
Traditional TAP has less detail than TAP-Y/J, but it can still be translated
with fairly good results. Tapout includes a TAP adapter to handle the
translation transparently. Current Tapout support TAP v12 with minor
limitations.

To learn about the TAP-Y/J specification, see the TAP-YJ.rdoc file.

For information about TAP, see http://testanything.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page.


== SYNOPSIS

Using a test framework that produces a TAP-Y output stream, simply pipe
the stream into `tapout`.

  $ ruby-test -y -Ilib test/foo.rb | tapout

Tapout supports a variety of output formats. These are selectable via the `-f`
option.

  $ ruby-test -y -Ilib test/foo.rb | tapout -f progessbar

Tapout is smart enough to match the closest matching format name. So, for
example, the above could be written as:

  $ ruby-test -y -Ilib test/foo.rb | tapout -f pro

And tapout will know to use the `progressbar` format.

To see a list of supported formats use the list subcommand:

  $ tapout list

If your test framework does not support TAP-Y, but does support traditional
TAP, Tapout will automatically recognize the difference by TAP's `1..N` header.

  $ ruby-test -ftap -Ilib test/foo.rb | tapout -f progressbar
